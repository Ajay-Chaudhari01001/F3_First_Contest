# Fronted 3 First Contest ( AccioJob )

## Project Task:
You are tasked with building a web page that displays data from three different APIs. Each API endpoint returns a JSON object which contains an array of items. Your goal is to fetch the data from all three endpoints and display it on the page in a table.
To do this, you will need to create three functions that each return a Promise that resolves with the data from their respective API endpoints. Each function should use fetch to make the API request and setTimeout to simulate a delay in the response. Also perform this using promise chaining.

### APIs Use in this project:
1) Posts -> https://dummyjson.com/posts
2) Products -> https://dummyjson.com/products
3) Todo -> https://dummyjson.com/todos
